	<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>
		<p>These terms and conditions govern the use of the stock balancing system (SBS), hereafter referred to as "the system," developed by <a href="">JTEK Technologies Co. LTD</a>, hereafter referred to as "the developer." By using the system, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, you must not use the system.</p>

		<li><strong>Use of the System</strong></li>
		<p>The system is designed to assist businesses in managing their stock levels. The developer makes no warranties or guarantees regarding the accuracy, reliability, or suitability of the system for any particular purpose.</p>

		<li><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></li>
		<p>The system and all associated intellectual property rights are owned by the developer. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the system for its intended purpose.</p>

		<li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></li>
		<p>The developer shall not be liable for any damages, including but not limited to, direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from the use of the system.</p>

		<li><strong>Indemnification</strong></li>
		<p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the developer from any claims, damages, or other liabilities arising from your use of the system.</p>

		<li><strong>Modification of Terms and Conditions</strong></li>
		<p>The developer reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions at any time. Your continued use of the system after such modifications shall constitute your acceptance of the modified terms and conditions.</p>

		<li><strong>Termination</strong></li>
		<p>The developer reserves the right to terminate your use of the system at any time for any reason.</p>
	</ol>

	<h1>Payment Conditions</h1>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Payment Terms</strong></li>
  <p>Payment for the use of the system shall be made in accordance with the payment terms agreed upon by you and the developer.</p>
  <li><strong>Payment Obligations</strong></li>
  <p>You agree to pay all fees and charges associated with the use of the system in a timely manner. Failure to do so may result in the suspension or termination of your use of the system.</p>
  <li><strong>Refunds</strong></li>
  <p>All fees and charges associated with the use of the system are non-refundable.</p>
  <li><strong>Monthly Payment Based on Business Value</strong></li>
  <p>The monthly payment for using the system is based on the value of your business, as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For business value less than 2 million Ugandan Shillings (UGX), the monthly payment is 20,000 UGX.</li>
    <li>For business value between 2 million and 5 million UGX, the monthly payment is 30,000 UGX.</li>
    <li>For business value greater than 5 million UGX, the monthly payment is 50,000 UGX.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To convert these figures into US dollars (USD), we need to know the current exchange rate between UGX and USD. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, 1 USD was approximately equal to 3,600 UGX. So, the monthly payment in USD would be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For business value less than 2 million UGX: 20,000 UGX รท 3,600 UGX/USD = $5.56 USD</li>
    <li>For business value between 2 million and 5 million UGX: 30,000 UGX รท 3,600 UGX/USD = $8.33 USD</li>
    <li>For business value greater than 5 million UGX: 50,000 UGX รท 3,600 UGX/USD = $13.89 USD</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
